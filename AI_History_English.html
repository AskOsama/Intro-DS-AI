            <span class="timeline-badge">1950s</span>
            <h2>The Birth of a Dream</h2>
            <p>
                The story begins in 1950 when Alan Turing asked a revolutionary question: "Can machines think?"
                His <strong>Turing Test</strong> proposed that if a machine could converse indistinguishably from a human,
                it could be considered intelligent. Six years later, in 1956, the term "<strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>"
                was officially coined at the Dartmouth Conference, where ambitious researchers gathered with boundless optimism.
            </p>
            <p>
                They created early programs like checkers-playing <strong>algorithms</strong> and believed human-level
                <strong>AI</strong> was just around the corner. The excitement was palpable—they thought they'd solve
                intelligence within a generation.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="period-section">
            <span class="timeline-badge">1960s-1970s</span>
            <h2>The Cold Reality</h2>
            <p>
                But reality proved harsher. Computers were painfully underpowered, barely able to handle the complex
                calculations <strong>AI</strong> required. Progress slowed to a crawl. The grand promises went unfulfilled,
                and funding dried up.
            </p>
            <p>
                This period became known as the first "<strong>AI Winter</strong>"—a time when the field nearly froze to
                death from lack of support and dashed expectations. Researchers learned a humbling lesson: intelligence
                was far more complex than anyone had imagined.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="period-section">
            <span class="timeline-badge">1980s</span>
            <h2>A Specialized Awakening</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>AI</strong> found new life through specialization. Expert systems like <strong>MYCIN</strong>,
                which diagnosed bacterial infections, showed that <strong>AI</strong> didn't need to be generally intelligent
                to be useful. Using simple IF-THEN rules, these <strong>knowledge-based systems</strong> captured human
                expertise in narrow domains.
            </p>
            <p>
                Businesses took notice, and investment poured in. But by the late 1980s, limitations became apparent—these
                <strong>systems</strong> were brittle, hard to maintain, and couldn't learn. Another <strong>AI Winter</strong>
                settled in.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="period-section">
            <span class="timeline-badge">1990s-2000s</span>
            <h2>Learning Machines Emerge</h2>
            <p>
                Everything changed when researchers shifted focus: instead of programming intelligence, why not let machines
                <em>learn</em> it from <strong>data</strong>? Computing power had finally caught up, the internet provided
                vast amounts of <strong>data</strong>, and <strong>machine learning</strong> techniques matured.
            </p>
            <p>
                The watershed moment came in 1997 when <strong>Deep Blue</strong> defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov.
                Suddenly, <strong>AI</strong> wasn't just theory—it was beating humans at their own games. Practical applications
                bloomed: spam filters, recommendation systems, and search engines all relied on <strong>machine learning</strong>
                working quietly behind the scenes.

        <div class="period-section">
            <span class="timeline-badge">2010s</span>
            <h2>The Deep Learning Revolution</h2>
            <p>
                Then came the earthquake. In 2012, a <strong>deep learning</strong> system crushed the ImageNet competition,
                recognizing images with unprecedented <strong>accuracy</strong>. This wasn't incremental progress—it was a
                paradigm shift.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Deep neural networks</strong>, inspired by the brain's structure, could <strong>learn</strong> complex
                patterns from raw <strong>data</strong>. <strong>AlphaGo</strong> defeated the world Go champion in 2016,
                mastering a game once thought impossible for machines. <strong>Self-driving cars</strong> hit the roads.
                <strong>Voice assistants</strong> moved into our homes. <strong>AI</strong> went from labs to everyday life,
                becoming truly mainstream.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="period-section">
            <span class="timeline-badge">2020s</span>
            <h2>The Current Era</h2>
            <p>
                We're now living through the most explosive period yet. <strong>GPT-3</strong> arrived in 2020, generating
                human-like text with stunning fluency. <strong>ChatGPT's</strong> release in late 2022 brought <strong>AI</strong>
                to hundreds of millions of people virtually overnight.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>AI systems</strong> now create art, write code, compose music, and assist in scientific discovery.
                But with this power come profound questions: How do we ensure <strong>AI</strong> is ethical and safe?
                Who controls these technologies? What happens to jobs? The rapid progress is exhilarating and unsettling
                in equal measure.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2 style="color: white; border: none; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                From Turing's simple question to today's powerful <strong>systems</strong>, <strong>AI's</strong> journey
                has been one of soaring hopes, crushing setbacks, patient rebuilding, and explosive breakthroughs. We're
                no longer asking <em>if</em> <strong>AI</strong> will transform society—we're navigating how to live in
                a world where it already has.
